## JMAP is on the home straight

27 December 2018 / Bron Gondwana

>In 2014, we talked about [JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/).  , the open protocol for modern email, which was born out of the web interface we have since 2011. We believe in open standards, both as a contribution to the community through what we have learned and as a bulwark against the growth of walled gardens.
JMAP in 2014 was a first draft protocol and an idea. JMAP in 2018 is almost finished the standard process and has a solid use in the real world.

23 December 2015 / Neil Jenkins

> In our advent blog series last year [we announced JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/), our effort to make a better standard for synchronising mail, calendars and contacts. Exactly one year on, we thought it would be good to give an update on our progress so far. Replacing ageing technology standards takes time, even when there are huge advantages over the previous generation, but we were delighted to see significant advancements this year. We've been talking with mailbox providers big and small, as well as server and client developers, to raise awareness and get people onboard. And already, the momentum is building.
