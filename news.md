## JMAP as RFC 8260 (Proposed Standard)

14 December 2019 / JMAP Community

> [On 18 July 2019](https://twitter.com/Fastmail/status/1152281229083009025), the Internet Engineering Task Force ([IETF](https://ietf.org/about)), the first Internet standards body, developing open standards through open processes, published the public specifications for JMAP as [RFC 8260](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8260), 
the next standard for e-mail protocols, it makes JMAP the true open and modern standard to [replace IMAP and SMTP](https://www.coywolf.news/email/jmap-open-standard/) that is not hindered by proprietary protocols. These published specifications are important because the IETF, a trusted publisher, reviews, refines and publishes high quality, fully open technical specifications that enable [web interoperability](https://www.coywolf.news/email/jmap-open-standard/).

> Emphasizing that open standards are [the engine of the power of the Internet](https://fastmail.blog/2019/08/16/jmap-new-email-open-standard/), JMAP standards are also open and have properties [that resolve the limitations](https://hub.packtpub.com/ietf-proposes-json-meta-application-protocol-jmap-as-the-next-standard-for-email-protocols/) encountered in current standards, making communication with mail servers [faster and more secure](https://www.coywolf.news/email/jmap-open-standard/). Here are some of the stunning benefits of JMAP: better for mobile environments, longer battery life for mobile users through query grouping, determination of the amount of data the server is allowed to send, a backward compatible data model, etc. 

> JMAP standards simply make life easier for developers and allow [efficient use of network resources](https://hub.packtpub.com/ietf-proposes-json-meta-application-protocol-jmap-as-the-next-standard-for-email-protocols/).
  Its standards ensure the proper functioning of the Internet, making it more useful, a demonstration of a great victory for email tools today and in the future. The published specifications have therefore [introduced JMAP to the world!](https://fastmail.blog/2019/08/16/jmap-new-email-open-standard/)

## K-9 Mail is working on adding JMAP support 

15 November 2019 / JMAP Community

> JMAP is in constant evolution, it has a lot to offer, especially on mobile devices for which IMAP has not been designed. Since its creation, more and more solutions have already supported it or are considering integrating it as a protocol. This is the case of [K-9 Mail](https://k9mail.github.io/) which is an open source email client for Android with many advanced features. 

>This was first announced as a proposed idea on K-9 Mail's proposed ideas page for [application for the Google Summer of Code 2017](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2017#jmap).
Then, in September 2019, in a [comment](https://github.com/k9mail/k-9/issues/3272#issuecomment-528326161), [Cketti](https://github.com/cketti) indicated a possible work on the JMAP support for 6 months from September.

> Moreover, through his [another comment](https://gitter.im/apache/james-project?at=5d766ca4c5939027203eb09d) of September 09, 2019, we can understand that the project is no longer in the proposed idea stage, but that he is already working on adding JMAP support to K-9 Mail.
> Find the list of [solutions](https://jmap.io/software.html) that already support JMAP and those that are already working on it.

## JMAP Barcamp 2019

## JMAP is on the home straight

27 December 2018 / Bron Gondwana

>In 2014, we talked about [JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/).  , the open protocol for modern email, which was born out of the web interface we have since 2011. We believe in open standards, both as a contribution to the community through what we have learned and as a bulwark against the growth of walled gardens.
JMAP in 2014 was a first draft protocol and an idea. JMAP in 2018 is almost finished the standard process and has a solid use in the real world.
Let's look at what has happened in the last 4 years.

## Dec 23: The JMAP momentum builds

23 December 2015 / Neil Jenkins

> In our advent blog series last year [we announced JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/), our effort to make a better standard for synchronising mail, calendars and contacts. Exactly one year on, we thought it would be good to give an update on our progress so far. Replacing ageing technology standards takes time, even when there are huge advantages over the previous generation, but we were delighted to see significant advancements this year. We've been talking with mailbox providers big and small, as well as server and client developers, to raise awareness and get people onboard. And already, the momentum is building.

## An open source JMAP proxy, JavaScript library and webmail demo

11 August 2015 / Neil Jenkins

>Last December[ we announced the JMAP project ](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/), our effort to develop a new open protocol for mail, calendar and contact clients that’s faster and more powerful than the current standards. Since then, we’ve continued to refine  [the specification](http://jmap.io/spec.html), and other companies have come on board to help build the future of email.  [Atmail](https://www.atmail.com/) is [using JMAP](https://www.atmail.com/blog/future-inbox) to power their next-generation mobile apps. The next version of [Roundcube](https://roundcube.net/), the world’s most popular open-source webmail, [will be built on JMAP](https://exote.ch/blogs/aseigo/2015/07/03/roundcube-next-the-next-steps/), with support from  [Kolab](https://kolab.org/). Thunderbird has started looking at [integrating support](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/sshagarwal/5733935958982656).
