>In 2014, we talked about [JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/).  , the open protocol for modern email, which was born out of the web interface we have since 2011. We believe in open standards, both as a contribution to the community through what we have learned and as a bulwark against the growth of walled gardens.
JMAP in 2014 was a first draft protocol and an idea. JMAP in 2018 is almost finished the standard process and has a solid use in the real world.
Let's look at what has happened in the last 4 years.

 Stay tuned for our final post tomorrow.
 In our advent blog series last year [we announced JMAP](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/), our effort to make a better standard for synchronising mail, calendars and contacts. Exactly one year on, we thought it would be good to give an update on our progress so far.
 Replacing ageing technology standards takes time, even when there are huge advantages over the previous generation, but we were delighted to see significant advancements this year. We've been talking with mailbox providers big and small, as well as server and client developers, to raise awareness and get people onboard. And already, the momentum is building.

  >Last December[ we announced the JMAP project ](https://fastmail.blog/2014/12/23/jmap-a-better-way-to-email/), our effort to develop a new open protocol for mail, calendar and contact clients that’s faster and more powerful than the current standards. Since then, we’ve continued to refine  [the specification](http://jmap.io/spec.html), and other companies have come on board to help build the future of email.  [Atmail](https://www.atmail.com/) is [using JMAP](https://www.atmail.com/blog/future-inbox) to power their next-generation mobile apps. The next version of [Roundcube](https://roundcube.net/), the world’s most popular open-source webmail, [will be built on JMAP](https://exote.ch/blogs/aseigo/2015/07/03/roundcube-next-the-next-steps/), with support from  [Kolab](https://kolab.org/). Thunderbird has started looking at [integrating support](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/project/details/google/gsoc2015/sshagarwal/5733935958982656).
