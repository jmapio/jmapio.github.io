# JMAP: The Specs

The specification for JMAP has now been split into several parts so it's not quite so big, and they can be finished and standardised independently.

There are four specifications:

* [The core protocol](spec-core.html)
* [JMAP Mail](spec-mail.html)
* [JMAP Contacts](spec-contacts.html)
* [JMAP Calendars](spec-calendars.html)

If you want to get a quick idea of how JMAP works, you should probably read [the guide for client developers](client.html) first. This has lots of example exchanges and should give you a good feel for what JMAP is all about. The specs are heavier going; they attempts to document exactly what each method should do, and what should happen in a myriad of edge cases.

There are undoubtably edge cases that are not yet covered. If you find one, please email [editor@jmap.io](mailto:editor@jmap.io) or make a pull request on GitHub if you have a proposed fix.
